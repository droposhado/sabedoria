# baserow.io models

In this document, the structures of the tables in baserow.io are detailed,
in order to use sabedoria, it is necessary that all the tables are created
with the same column types, the values can vary.

The `xx-XX` notation should be replaced by the language you want to use,
I use `pt-BR` and `en-US` just to standardize, but you can use whatever
you want, actually the string you want to identify a language, you just
need to ensure that all the places they use are the same, with case
sensitivity. For each language a column, with the suffix of your choice.
